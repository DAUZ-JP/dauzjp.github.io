    <h3 align = "center"> Skill </h3>
    <p align="Justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really believe that each of us is exceptional because of the individual skills and talents we all possess.<sup>1</sup> People are skilled in a variety of disciplines, including acting, singing, playing an instrument, and participating in sports and other activities.<sup>2</sup> At various times throughout their lives, people become aware of their talents.<sup>3</sup> What makes a difference is how I give back to the society by imparting my knowledge.<sup>4</sup> Everyone is exceptionally good at at least one thing.<sup>5</sup> The universe transforms into a work of art when each of us combines our unique talents.<sup>6</sup> I've been fortunate and blessed with the ability to play basketball, and I love practicing this sport out of pure altruism.<sup>7</sup> I used to play basketball for my school when I was in elementary school.<sup>8</sup> Every weekday from 4 to 6 o'clock we practice.<sup>9</sup> As a result of playing this sport, I made new pals. I've traveled to several locations purely for competitive gaming.<sup>10</sup> Just from playing, I've picked up decent sportsmanship.<sup>11</sup> God has given each of us a special set of abilities.<sup>12</sup> By enjoying sports or improving your skills, we may band together and use our unique talents to inspire others to support a good cause. We have the power to improve the lives of others.<sup>13</sup>

    <h3 align = "center"> Hobby </h3>
	<p align="Justify">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lives depend heavily on our hobbies.<sup>1</sup> When we have spare time, they keep our minds busy and bring us joy.<sup>2</sup> Hobbies help us forget our troubles by providing an escape from the actual world.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, they add interest and pleasure to our lives.<sup>4</sup> If we think about it, all of our interests are highly beneficial to us.<sup>5</sup> They instruct us on a wide range of topics.<sup>6</sup> They also contribute to knowledge growth.<sup>7</sup> Dancing would be my top choice if I had to choose just one of my numerous interests. Since I was a very small child, I have enjoyed dancing.<sup>8</sup> My parents thought I was a dancer from birth because of the way my feet responded to the beat of the music.<sup>9</sup> I've always loved music and dancing. Dancing is highly uplifting and inexpensive.<sup>10</sup> I had no idea, though, how much pure delight they provide to others.<sup>11</sup> We get a lot of workout while we dance.<sup>12</sup> It teaches us how to move our bodies in time with the pulse of the music.<sup>13</sup> Exercise like this is incredibly fun and enjoyable.<sup>14</sup> Simply said, I feel alive and well when I'm dancing.<sup>15</sup> I only have one thing I eagerly anticipate it.<sup>16</sup> So, I'm hoping to realize my dream and pave the path for those who want to turn their passions into careers.<sup>17</sup>

    <h3 align = "center"> Interest </h3> 
	<p align="Justify">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In common usage, interest has various meanings, many of which are overly ambiguous.<sup>1</sup> Interest has many different definitions and uses in daily life.<sup>2</sup> One of my other interests is travel.<sup>3</sup> I never pass up the chance to explore a new location, whether it be a village, city, mountain, or seashore.<sup>4</sup> Visiting new places and getting to know new people is such an exciting experience.<sup>5</sup> Every time I visit a new location, I bring my camera and capture intriguing photos of the locals, the architecture, the monuments, the bazaar, and so on.<sup>6</sup> I get tremendous joy and pleasure doing it. Although this hobby is pricey, I would like to test it.<sup>7</sup>
